## Overview

This session focuses on using compound components, models, and behavior hooks to build UI with Canvas Kit.

## Audience

This session is for folks who consume Canvas Kit in their applications. While we are not targeting a particular experience-level (junior, mid-level, or senior), we expect participants to have a working understanding of React and a general familiarity with Canvas Kit.

## Key Questions

- What are compound components, and why are they useful?
- What are models, and why are they useful?
- What are behavior hooks, and why are they useful?

## Objectives

Upon completing this session, participants should:

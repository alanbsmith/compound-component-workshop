# Canvas Kit Compound Component Workshop

## Overview

This workshop focuses on new components and patterns we'll be releasing in Canvas Kit v5. You'll get hands-on experience as we build a basic UI together.

## Audience

This workshop is designed for those who consume and contribute to Canvas Kit. While we are not targeting a particular experience-level (junior, mid-level, or senior), we expect participants to have a working understanding of React and a general familiarity with Canvas Kit. Session 3 also contains more advanced material that will likely be most beneficial for folks contributing to Canvas Kit or building custom compound components. That said, if you'd like to dive deeper or are just curious, feel free to join us.

## Objectives

This workshop will help you:

- implement our layout and typography components
- consume and customize our compound components
- build your own compound components
